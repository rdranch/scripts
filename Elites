'''
The first option, to install the program.
1. Looks up your ubisoft ID on R6tracker. R6Tracker contains a permanent link section
which is HTML scrapped and saved here.
2. Renames your 1.save to 2.save before continuing. Checks to see if 2.save already exists because if it does, this program doesn't
need to be ran.
3. Downloads the Elite 1.save file off private google drive.
4. Creates a text file that keeps track of the ID's installed so that if the user decides to uninstall the program,
they can do it with ease.
